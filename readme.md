# findlink

## Link to any text on a page.

The findlink extension lets anyone link to any specific piece of text on a web page via a special link fragment syntax: `#find(my search text)`.

Use this extension if you often encounter elements on web pages that you want to link to, but can't because the elements haven't been given a proper ID.
